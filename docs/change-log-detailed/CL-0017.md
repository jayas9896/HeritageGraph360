# CL-0017: Strengthen gateway JWT role mapping and auth config

## Summary
This change maps JWT role claims to Spring Security authorities and adds sample OAuth2/SAML configuration.

## Motivation
Role-based access requires explicit mapping of JWT claims, and auth examples are needed for OAuth2/SAML setup.

## Changes
- Added JWT authorities converter in gateway security configuration.
- Added sample OAuth2 and SAML provider settings in identity-service application config.

## Verification
- Pending: `mvn -q -DskipTests=false verify`.

## Risks
- Role mapping assumes a `roles` claim in JWT tokens.

## Rollback
- Revert gateway JWT converter and auth configuration entries.

## Notes
- Align claim names with the chosen OAuth2 provider.
