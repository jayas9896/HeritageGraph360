# CL-0018: Add audit trail retrieval API

## Summary
This change adds an audit log retrieval endpoint and supporting response models.

## Motivation
Audit trails are required for compliance and lineage verification.

## Changes
- Added audit controller and response DTOs.
- Added repository query for tenant-scoped audit logs.

## Verification
- Pending: `mvn -q -DskipTests=false verify`.

## Risks
- Audit endpoints may require additional access controls.

## Rollback
- Remove audit controller, DTOs, and repository method.

## Notes
