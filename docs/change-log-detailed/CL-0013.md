# CL-0013: Implement profile workflows, merges, and event payload storage

## Summary
This change wires profile workflow services, persists merges, and stores dynamic event payloads in MongoDB.

## Motivation
Profile lifecycle operations require persistence, audit trails, and dynamic event storage for lineage workflows.

## Changes
- Added merge entity and repository with SQL schema updates.
- Added profile workflow service with audit and event payload persistence.
- Added MongoDB documents for event payloads and evidence records.
- Updated controllers to use workflow service and enforce tenant/actor headers.
- Updated REST/OpenAPI docs to reflect header requirements.
- Adjusted controller tests for new workflow handling.

## Verification
- Pending: `mvn -q -DskipTests=false verify`.

## Risks
- Workflow service uses basic validation and may need richer business rules.

## Rollback
- Revert workflow service, merge entity, Mongo documents, and controller updates.

## Notes
- Add more integration tests for persistence and workflow state transitions.
