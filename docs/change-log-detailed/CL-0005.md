# CL-0005: Add insights, observability, and deployment assets

## Summary
This change adds insight APIs, RabbitMQ/Kafka consumers, OpenAI summarization stubs, observability assets, and local deployment tooling.

## Motivation
The platform requires asynchronous insight processing, monitoring, and repeatable local deployment for demos and validation.

## Changes
- Added insights REST endpoint, Kafka consumer, RabbitMQ queues, and OpenAI client stub.
- Added gateway security configuration for public and role-based access.
- Added Prometheus/Grafana assets and observability documentation.
- Added Docker Compose and Kubernetes dependency manifests.
- Updated deployment and AI insight documentation along with README links.

## Verification
- Not run (scaffold-level changes).

## Risks
- Monitoring and deployment assets may need environment-specific tuning.

## Rollback
- Revert insights service additions and remove infra/monitoring and deployment files.

## Notes
- Add integration tests and dashboard provisioning in future sprints.
