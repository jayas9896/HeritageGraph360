# CL-0016: Add duplicate detection and profile display names

## Summary
This change adds duplicate detection logic, profile display names, and merge status adjustments based on similarity rules.

## Motivation
The platform requires 90% name similarity with shared contact matching to flag potential duplicates.

## Changes
- Added display name field to profile entity and SQL schema.
- Added duplicate detection service with Levenshtein similarity.
- Updated profile workflow service to evaluate duplicate status for merges.

## Verification
- Pending: `mvn -q -DskipTests=false verify`.

## Risks
- Similarity calculation may need tuning for real-world data.

## Rollback
- Remove duplicate detection service and revert profile schema changes.

## Notes
- Consider using Jaro-Winkler or ML-based matching in future.
