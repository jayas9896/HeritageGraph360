# CL-0020: Enforce role-based access in profile and insights services

## Summary
This change adds method-level role enforcement and security configuration for profile and insights services.

## Motivation
Sensitive workflows and audit access must be restricted to reviewer/admin roles.

## Changes
- Added Spring Security configurations for profile and insights services.
- Added method-level role checks on audit, merge decisions, approvals, sensitive fields, and insights.
- Updated API documentation and security notes.

## Verification
- mvn -q -DskipTests=false verify (pass).

## Risks
- Role mapping assumes `roles` claim in JWTs.

## Rollback
- Remove method security annotations and security configuration classes.

## Notes
- Align JWT role claims with identity provider mappings.
