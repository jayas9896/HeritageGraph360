# CL-0026: Enforce tenant format and enrich profile/evidence flows

## Summary
This change enforces tenant ID format at the gateway, publishes profile events to Kafka, and enriches evidence storage with profile linkage.

## Motivation
Tenant formatting and event propagation are required for consistent multi-tenant processing and pipeline integrity.

## Changes
- Enforced tenant ID format in gateway header filter.
- Added profile event publisher and wired it into profile workflows.
- Added profile linkage to evidence records and persistence.
- Enriched ingestion payloads and improved insight profile ID extraction.
- Updated NoSQL schema documentation.

## Verification
- Pending: `mvn -q -DskipTests=false verify`.

## Risks
- Invalid tenant IDs now return 400 at the gateway.

## Rollback
- Remove tenant format checks and event publishing changes.

## Notes
- Consider adding validation errors in response bodies for failed requests.
