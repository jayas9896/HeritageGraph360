# CL-0015: Fix Kinesis record serialization in ingestion service

## Summary
This change fixes Kinesis record publishing by using SdkBytes for payload data.

## Motivation
AWS SDK v2 expects SdkBytes instead of ByteBuffer for Kinesis records.

## Changes
- Updated Kinesis PutRecordRequest payload to use SdkBytes.

## Verification
- mvn -q -DskipTests=false verify (pass).

## Risks
- Low risk; only affects Kinesis serialization.

## Rollback
- Revert SdkBytes usage in ingestion processing.

## Notes
- Ensure Kinesis is enabled only with valid credentials.
