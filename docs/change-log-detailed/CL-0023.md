# CL-0023: Add field-level grants and profile query access control

## Summary
This change adds per-person visibility grants and a profile query endpoint that enforces field-level access.

## Motivation
Field-level visibility and explicit grants are mandatory for sensitive profile data.

## Changes
- Added profile grant entity, repository, and grant service.
- Added profile grant controller and profile query controller.
- Added SQL schema table for profile grants.
- Updated REST API documentation.

## Verification
- mvn -q -DskipTests=false verify (pass).

## Risks
- Grant checks are basic and may need optimization.

## Rollback
- Remove grant entities, services, and profile query endpoint.

## Notes
- Consider pagination and caching for large grant lists.
