# CL-0002: Add ingestion pipelines with gRPC and streaming configs

## Summary
This change adds gRPC and REST ingestion endpoints, Kafka/Kinesis integration stubs, and ingestion pipeline documentation.

## Motivation
The platform requires high-throughput ingestion for archival datasets and stream-based propagation of profile events.

## Changes
- Added gRPC proto and service implementation for bulk ingestion.
- Added REST ingestion endpoint and request/response DTOs.
- Added Kafka topic constants, Kinesis client config, and event publisher.
- Documented ingestion pipelines and gRPC API definitions.

## Verification
- Not run (scaffold-level changes).

## Risks
- Integration wiring may require runtime configuration for Kafka and Kinesis.

## Rollback
- Revert ingestion service files and remove pipeline documentation.

## Notes
- Follow-up will add integration tests with embedded Kafka/Kinesis mocks.
