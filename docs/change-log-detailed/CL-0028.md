# CL-0028: Add policy evaluation API and service

## Summary
- Add policy evaluation API and service wiring to support tenant policy decisions.

## Motivation
- Policy consumers need a centralized decision endpoint to validate access against stored tenant policies.

## Changes
- Added policy evaluation request/response DTOs and service in identity-service.
- Added policy evaluation endpoint to the policy controller.
- Updated policy repository with targeted query helper.
- Documented the new policy evaluation endpoint in REST API docs.

## Verification
- mvn -q -DskipTests=false verify (pass)

## Risks
- Policy evaluation currently checks allow/deny without conditions evaluation.

## Rollback
- Revert policy evaluation API/service classes, repository method, and docs entry.

## Notes
- Follow-up can add conditions JSON validation and evaluator logic.
