# CL-0004: Add profile domain APIs and approval workflows

## Summary
This change introduces profile domain entities, repositories, and REST APIs for claims, relationships, merges, and approvals.

## Motivation
Profile lifecycle and lineage workflows require durable domain models with auditable update paths.

## Changes
- Added SQL-backed profile, relationship, audit, and approval entities.
- Added repositories for profile domain persistence.
- Added REST controllers and DTOs for claim, relationship, merge, and approval workflows.
- Added profile validation unit test and REST API documentation updates.

## Verification
- Not run (scaffold-level changes).

## Risks
- Controllers currently return placeholder responses without persistence.

## Rollback
- Revert profile domain and API files and remove related docs.

## Notes
- Next step is wiring services to repositories and audit logging.
