# CL-0011: Add runbook, OpenAPI sample, and gitignore

## Summary
This change adds operational runbook guidance, an OpenAPI sample definition, and a repository gitignore.

## Motivation
Operational readiness and API examples are required for enterprise-grade delivery and clean repo hygiene.

## Changes
- Added `docs/runbook.md` with incident and recovery steps.
- Added `docs/api/openapi-example.yaml` for REST API documentation.
- Added `.gitignore` to exclude build outputs and IDE files.
- Linked new docs in README.

## Verification
- Not run (documentation-only changes).

## Risks
- Low risk; documentation and ignore rules only.

## Rollback
- Remove runbook, OpenAPI sample, and .gitignore entries.

## Notes
- Consider expanding OpenAPI with auth/security schemes.
