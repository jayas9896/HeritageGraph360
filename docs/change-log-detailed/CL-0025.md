# CL-0025: Add evidence ingestion and event payload persistence

## Summary
This change adds evidence ingestion endpoints, profile event storage, and enriched ingestion payloads.

## Motivation
Evidence metadata and event payloads must be persisted for audit and lineage verification.

## Changes
- Added evidence ingestion service and controller.
- Added profile event consumer to persist Kafka event payloads.
- Enriched ingestion payloads with tenant and event metadata.
- Updated REST API documentation for evidence ingestion.

## Verification
- mvn -q -DskipTests=false verify (pass).

## Risks
- Event payloads may require schema validation for production use.

## Rollback
- Remove evidence ingestion and event consumer components.

## Notes
- Consider normalizing payloads for analytics pipelines.
