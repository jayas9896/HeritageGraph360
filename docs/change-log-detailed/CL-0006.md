# CL-0006: Add policy persistence and domain rules docs

## Summary
This change adds policy persistence entities, updates SQL schema, and documents domain-specific rules and demo scenarios.

## Motivation
Policies are required for field-level visibility and domain rules must be explicit for consistent workflows.

## Changes
- Added policy entity and repository to identity-service.
- Added SQL schema table for policies.
- Documented domain rules and demo scenarios.
- Updated security and architecture docs to reference policy enforcement.

## Verification
- Not run (scaffold-level changes).

## Risks
- Policy evaluation is not yet wired into runtime authorization.

## Rollback
- Revert policy entity files, schema changes, and docs.

## Notes
- Follow-up should integrate policy evaluation into gateway and profile services.
