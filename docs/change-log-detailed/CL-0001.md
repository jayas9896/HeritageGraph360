# CL-0001: Initial scaffold with Maven modules and baseline docs

## Summary
This change adds the initial multi-module Maven structure, baseline service scaffolds, and foundational documentation for HeritageGraph360.

## Motivation
The project requires a cohesive enterprise-grade foundation with clear standards, module layout, and documentation to support incremental delivery.

## Changes
- Created Maven parent and module POMs for core services.
- Added basic Spring Boot application entrypoints and shared utilities.
- Added Checkstyle configuration enforcing Javadoc requirements.
- Added initial documentation placeholders and project structure.

## Verification
- Not run (new project scaffold only).

## Risks
- Low risk; scaffolding may need adjustments as features are implemented.

## Rollback
- Remove added files and directories introduced in the scaffold.

## Notes
- Update this log with each subsequent commit using the CL-XXXX format.
