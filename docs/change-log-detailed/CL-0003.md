# CL-0003: Add tenant provisioning and RBAC persistence model

## Summary
This change introduces tenant provisioning endpoints, identity domain entities, and RBAC persistence models for roles and permissions.

## Motivation
Multi-tenant security requires durable identity records and role-based access enforcement backed by SQL.

## Changes
- Added tenant and account entities with JPA repositories.
- Added RBAC entities for roles, permissions, and mappings with repositories.
- Added tenant provisioning API and RBAC service helpers.
- Documented security model and configuration examples.

## Verification
- Not run (scaffold-level changes).

## Risks
- RBAC queries are simple placeholders and may need optimization.

## Rollback
- Revert identity-domain and RBAC files and remove related docs.

## Notes
- Follow-up should wire RBAC into Spring Security authorities.
