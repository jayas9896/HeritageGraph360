# CL-0019: Add encrypted sensitive field storage

## Summary
This change introduces encrypted storage for sensitive profile fields with audit logging.

## Motivation

- Added AES-GCM encryption utility and sensitive field service.
- Added API endpoint to store sensitive fields with audit logs.
- Updated NoSQL schema and REST docs.

## Verification
- mvn -q -DskipTests=false verify (pass).

## Risks
