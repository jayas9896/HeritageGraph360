# CL-0014: Implement insights processing and ingestion workflow services

## Summary
This change wires insights processing with RabbitMQ/Mongo persistence and implements ingestion workflow services for Kafka/Kinesis.

## Motivation
Async insight processing and ingestion pipelines must move beyond placeholders to functional workflow services.

## Changes
- Added insight summary MongoDB documents, repositories, and job processing.
- Updated Kafka consumer to enqueue insight jobs.
- Updated insights API to read from MongoDB with tenant header enforcement.
- Added ingestion properties and processing service with Kinesis toggle.
- Updated ingestion REST and gRPC handlers to call processing service.
- Updated MongoDB schemas and REST/OpenAPI docs for header usage.

## Verification
- Pending: `mvn -q -DskipTests=false verify`.

## Risks
- Kinesis publishing depends on credentials when enabled.

## Rollback
- Revert insights job classes, ingestion services, and related doc updates.

## Notes
- Consider adding integration tests with embedded RabbitMQ and Kafka.
